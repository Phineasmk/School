CSCI361: Cryptography and Secure Individual Assignment 2 (10%)

Aim: To become familiar with block ciphers, mode of operations, the importance of S-box and cryptanalysis of linear cipher. In this assignment, you will implement two “mini" versions of DES called LDES and MDES which work on 4-bit block message and 2-bit key. In the first algorithm LDES, the S-box is removed and replaced with a linear operation making LDES a linear cipher. You will perform cryptanalysis on LDES. The second algorithm MDES has a S- box, and it is secure against linear cryptanalysis.
You are required to complete all the questions 1-8. The detail is explained in the following pages.
Notes
This assignment includes two questions LDES and MDES.
•   Provide a report for Q1 and Q2 in pdf file. Clearly label which questions your answers.
•   For programming questions, you can use any language of Python, Java, or C++ to
implement the solution. All source code needs to be submitted with the report. (No
mark given for question if No source code submitted)
•   Provide detail on how to run your program in the report (e.g., the used IDE etc...). Give suitable comments and personal detail in the program to show it is your own work. For example, format the output to include your specific information, format.


Q1 : LDES
The figure below describes a block cipher LDES (“linear" DES).
The LDES is a mini example of a block cipher that has 2 rounds in the Feistel network. It operates on 4-bit block and 2-bit key. The important feature of LDES is that the S-box has been replaced with a linear operation which makes the whole cipher linear. The purpose of this exercise is to help you understand the importance of S-box in DES. Without the S-box, the cipher becomes linear and can be totally broken.

a. Implement the encryption algorithms using C++, Python or Java languages
Test your program with the following messages for each key = 00, 01, 10, Show all I/O of running the programs.
E(0000), E(1000), E(0100), E(0010), E(0001), E(1100),E(1010), E(1001), E(0110), E(0101), E(0011), E(0111), E(1011), E(1101), E(1110), E(1111).

c. Verify that, for every key that the cyphertext of E(1100) is the sum (in binary output) of cyphertext of E(1000) + E(0100) + E(0000). (e.g., that is E(1100) = E(1000) + E(0100) + E(0000))

[Bonus: 2 marks for final result will be given to those also implement the decryption algorithm of the LDES cipher]
 

Write similar equations for E(1010), E(1001), E(0110), E(0101), E(0011), E(0111), E(1011), E(1101), E(1110), E(1111) demonstrates that if Oscar knows E(0000), E(1000), E(0100), E(0010), E(0001) can break these messages.
NOTE: it is to prove that
E(1010) = E(0000) + E(1000) + E(0100) + E(0010) + E(0001) E(1001) = E(0000) + E(1000) + E(0100) + E(0010) + E(0001) E(0110) = E(0000) + E(1000) + E(0100) + E(0010) + E(0001)
......
For all E(0101), E(0011), E(0111), E(1011), E(1101), E(1110), E(1111)

Q2: MDES
Consider a block cipher MDES (“mini" DES) which works exactly the same as LDES, except that the operation from (I1; I2; I3) to (J1; J2) is based on the following S-box.
Now design a new program (so you need to submit TWO programs) with modify the LDES algorithm to implement the MDES.

Test your program with the key set and message as in part 1:

for each key = 00, 01, 10, Show all I/O of running the programs.
E(0000), E(1000), E(0100), E(0010), E(0001), E(1100),E(1010), E(1001), E(0110), E(0101), E(0011), E(0111), E(1011), E(1101), E(1110), E(1111).

Demonstrated with the outputs whether the MDES still has the problem of point (c) still exists in LDES.
